# 3b4th - 3 bits FORTH - The most-est minimalist CPU ever

3 bits FORTH -- a minimalist 3-bit CPU which runs a minimalist FORTH.

Lets start with this LED panel, and turn it into a minimalistic "visible"
computer.

1. A 64x32 LED panel is a 64x32 RAM, 3 bits (7-colors) each.

2. Bolt it to an ALU, which has a single stack-oriented arithmetic
instruction (minus), and six other data movement instructions.

3. Lets power this with a Reverse Polish compiler, that uses combinators
instead of GoTo.

4. Then, finally lets bestow it all with unbounded Virtual Memory, with
segmentation protection.

And .. Lo behold, we have a most-minimalistic 3-bit 4th (ie. 3b4th)  computer.
